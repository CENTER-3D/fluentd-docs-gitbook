# Install By Gem

This article explains how to install Fluentd using Ruby gem.

## Step0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install.md) to configure your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.

## Step1: Install Ruby interpreter

Please install Ruby &gt;= 1.9.3 on your local environment. In addition, install ruby-dev package via package manager to build native extension gems.

## Step2: Install Fluentd gem

Fetch and install the `fluentd` Ruby gem using the `gem` command. The official ruby gem page is [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/fluentd).

```text
$ gem install fluentd -v "~> 0.12.0" --no-ri --no-rdoc
```

`-v "~> 0.12.0"` is needed for v0.12 installation. Without it, you install v0.14 series.

## Step3: Run

Run the following commands to confirm that Fluentd was installed successfully:

```text
$ fluentd --setup ./fluent
$ fluentd -c ./fluent/fluent.conf -vv & # -vv enables trace level logs. You can omit -vv option.
$ echo '{"json":"message"}' | fluent-cat debug.test
```

The last command sends Fluentd a message '{"json":"message"}' with a "debug.test" tag. If the installation was successful, Fluentd will output the following message:

```text
2011-07-10 16:49:50 +0900 debug.test: {"json":"message"}
```

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up **ntpd** on the node to prevent invalid timestamps in your logs.

For large deployments, you must use [jemalloc](http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/) to avoid memory fragmentation. This is already included in the [rpm](install-by-rpm.md) and [deb](install-by-deb.md) packages.

The Fluentd gem doesn't come with /etc/init.d/ scripts. You should use process management tools such as [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html), [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/), [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/), or [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/).
