# scribe

![](../.gitbook/assets/scribe.png)

The `in_scribe` Input plugin enables Fluentd to retrieve records through the Scribe protocol. [Scribe](https://github.com/facebook/scribe) is another log collector daemon that is open-sourced by Facebook.

Since Scribe hasn't been well maintained recently, this plugin is useful for existing Scribe users who want to use Fluentd with an existing Scribe infrastructure.

## Install

`in_scribe` is included in td-agent by default. Fluentd gem users will need to install the fluent-plugin-scribe gem using the following command.

```text
$ fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-scribe
```

## Example Configuration

```text
<source>
  @type scribe
  port 1463

  bind 0.0.0.0
  msg_format json
</source>
```

Please see the [Config File](../configuration/config-file.md) article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Example Usage

We assume that you're already familiar with the Scribe protocol. This [Ruby example code](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-plugin-scribe/blob/master/bin/fluent-scribe-remote) posts logs to `in_scribe`.

Scribe's `category` field becomes the `tag` of the Fluentd event log and Scribe's `message` field becomes the record itself. The `msg_format` parameter specifies the format of the `message` field.

## Parameters

#### type \(required\)

The value must be `scribe`.

#### port

The port to listen to. Default Value = 1463

#### bind

The bind address to listen to. Default Value = 0.0.0.0 \(all addresses\)

#### msg\_format

The message format can be 'text', 'json', or 'url\_param' \(default: text\)

For `json`, Fluentd's record is organized as follows. Scribe's message field must be a valid JSON string representing Hash; otherwise, the record is ignored.

```text
tag: $category
record: $message
```

For `text`, Fluentd's record is organized as follows. Scribe's message can be any arbitrary string, but JSON is recommended for ease of use with the subsequent analytics pipeline.

```text
tag: $category
record: {'message': $message}
```

For `url_param`, Fluentd's record is organized as follows. Scribe's message field must contain URL parameter style key-value pairs with URL encoding \(e.g. key1=val1&key2=val2\).

```text
tag: $url_param
record: {$key1: $val1, $key2: $val2, ...}
```

#### is\_framed

Specifies whether to use Thrift's framed protocol or not \(default: true\).

#### server\_type

Chooses the server architecture. Options are 'simple', 'threaded', 'thread\_pool', or 'nonblocking' \(default: nonblocking\).

#### add\_prefix

The prefix string which will always be added to the tag \(default: nil\).

#### log\_level option

The `log_level` option allows the user to set different levels of logging for each plugin. The supported log levels are: `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.
