# dummy

![](../.gitbook/assets/dummy.png)

The `in_dummy` input plugin generates dummy events. It is useful for testing, debugging, benchmarking and getting started with Fluentd.

## Example Configuration

`in_dummy` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

```text
<source>
  @type dummy
  dummy {"hello":"world"}
</source>
```

Please see the [Config File](../configuration/config-file.md) article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

## Parameters

### type \(required\)

The value must be `dummy`.

### tag \(required\)

The value is the tag assigned to the generated events.

### dummy \(optional\)

The dummy data to be generated. It should be either an array of JSON hashes or a single JSON hash. If it is an array of JSON hashes, the hashes in the array are cycled through in order. By default, the value is `[{"message":"dummy"}]` \(i.e., it continues to generate events with the record {"message":"dummy"}\).

### auto\_increment\_key \(optional, string type\)

If specified, each generated event has an auto-incremented key field. For example, with `auto_increment_key foo_key`, the first couple of events look like

```text
2014-12-14 23:23:38 +0000 test: {"message":"dummy","foo_key":0}
2014-12-14 23:23:38 +0000 test: {"message":"dummy","foo_key":1}
2014-12-14 23:23:38 +0000 test: {"message":"dummy","foo_key":2}
```

### rate \(optional, integer type\)

It configures how many events to generate per second. The default value is 1.

#### log\_level option

The `log_level` option allows the user to set different levels of logging for each plugin. The supported log levels are: `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.

Please see the [logging article](../deployment/logging.md) for further details.
