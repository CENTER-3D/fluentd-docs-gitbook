# copy

![](../.gitbook/assets/copy.png)

The `copy` output plugin copies events to multiple outputs.

## Example Configuration

`out_copy` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

```text
<match pattern>
  @type copy
  <store>
    @type file
    path /var/log/fluent/myapp1
    ...
  </store>
  <store>
    ...
  </store>
  <store>
    ...
  </store>
</match>
```

Please see the [Config File](../configuration/config-file.md) article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

Here is an example set up to send events to both a local file under `/var/log/fluent/myapp` and the collection `fluentd.test` in a local MongoDB instance \(Please see the [out\_file](file.md) and [out\_mongo](mongo.md) articles for more details about the respective plugins.\)

```text
<match myevent.file_and_mongo>
  @type copy
  <store>
    @type file
    path /var/log/fluent/myapp
    time_slice_format %Y%m%d
    time_slice_wait 10m
    time_format %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z
    compress gzip
    utc
  </store>
  <store>
    @type mongo
    host fluentd
    port 27017
    database fluentd
    collection test
  </store>
</match>
```

## Parameters

### type \(required\)

The value must be `copy`.

### deep\_copy

`out_copy` shares a record between `store` plugins by default.

When `deep_copy` is true, `out_copy` passes different record to each `store` plugin.

### &lt;store&gt; \(at least one required\)

Specifies the storage destinations. The format is the same as the \ directive.

#### log\_level option

The `log_level` option allows the user to set different levels of logging for each plugin. The supported log levels are: `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.

Please see the [logging article](../deployment/logging.md) for further details.

## FAQ

### How to ignore each error in \\?

If one `store` raises an error, it affects other `<store>`. If you want to ignore an exception from less important `<store>`, you can use 3rd party [out\_copy\_ex](https://github.com/sonots/fluent-plugin-copy_ex) instead.
