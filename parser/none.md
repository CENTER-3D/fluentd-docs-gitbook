# none

The `none` parser plugin parses the line as-is with single field. This format is to defer parsing/structuring the data.

## Parameters

### message\_key

Specify field name to contain logs. Default is `message`.

## Example

```text
Hello world. I am a line of log!
```

This incoming event is parsed as:

```text
time:
1362020400 (current time)

record:
{"message":"Hello world. I am a line of log!"}
```
