# nginx

The `nginx` parser plugin parses default nginx logs.

## Parameters

### keep\_time\_key

If you want to keep time field in the record, set `true`. Default is `false`.

### types

Although every parsed field has type `string` by default, you can specify other types. This is useful when filtering particular fields numerically or storing data with sensible type information.

The syntax is

```text
types <field_name_1>:<type_name_1>,<field_name_2>:<type_name_2>,...
```

e.g.,

```text
types user_id:integer,paid:bool,paid_usd_amount:float
```

As demonstrated above, "," is used to delimit field-type pairs while ":" is used to separate a field name with its intended type.

Unspecified fields are parsed at the default string type.

The list of supported types are shown below:

* string
* bool
* integer \("int" would NOT work!\)
* float
* time
* array

For the `time` and `array` types, there is an optional third field after the type name. For the "time" type, you can specify a time format like you would in `time_format`.

For the "array" type, the third field specifies the delimiter \(the default is ","\). For example, if a field called "item\_ids" contains the value "3,4,5", `types item_ids:array` parses it as \["3", "4", "5"\]. Alternatively, if the value is "Adam\|Alice\|Bob", `types item_ids:array:|` parses it as \["Adam", "Alice", "Bob"\].

## Regexp patterns

This is regexp and time format patterns of this plugin:

```text
format /^(?<remote>[^ ]*) (?<host>[^ ]*) (?<user>[^ ]*) \[(?<time>[^\]]*)\] "(?<method>\S+)(?: +(?<path>[^\"]*) +\S*)?" (?<code>[^ ]*) (?<size>[^ ]*)(?: "(?<referer>[^\"]*)" "(?<agent>[^\"]*)")?$/
time_format %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z
```

`remote`, `user`, `method`, `path`, `code`, `size`, `referer` and `agent` are included in the event record. `time` is used for the event time.

## Example

```text
127.0.0.1 192.168.0.1 - [28/Feb/2013:12:00:00 +0900] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 777 "-" "Opera/12.0"
```

This incoming event is parsed as:

```text
time:
1362020400 (28/Feb/2013:12:00:00 +0900)

record:
{
  "remote" : "127.0.0.1",
  "host"   : "192.168.0.1",
  "user"   : "-",
  "method" : "GET",
  "path"   : "/",
  "code"   : "200",
  "size"   : "777",
  "referer": "-",
  "agent"  : "Opera/12.0"
}
```
