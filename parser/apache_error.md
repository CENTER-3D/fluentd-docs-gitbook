# apache\_error

The `apache_error` parser plugin parses apache error logs.

## Parameters

### keep\_time\_key

If you want to keep time field in the record, set `true`. Default is `false`.

### types

Although every parsed field has type `string` by default, you can specify other types. This is useful when filtering particular fields numerically or storing data with sensible type information.

The syntax is

```text
types <field_name_1>:<type_name_1>,<field_name_2>:<type_name_2>,...
```

e.g.,

```text
types user_id:integer,paid:bool,paid_usd_amount:float
```

As demonstrated above, "," is used to delimit field-type pairs while ":" is used to separate a field name with its intended type.

Unspecified fields are parsed at the default string type.

The list of supported types are shown below:

* string
* bool
* integer \("int" would NOT work!\)
* float
* time
* array

For the `time` and `array` types, there is an optional third field after the type name. For the "time" type, you can specify a time format like you would in `time_format`.

For the "array" type, the third field specifies the delimiter \(the default is ","\). For example, if a field called "item\_ids" contains the value "3,4,5", `types item_ids:array` parses it as \["3", "4", "5"\]. Alternatively, if the value is "Adam\|Alice\|Bob", `types item_ids:array:|` parses it as \["Adam", "Alice", "Bob"\].

## Regexp patterns

This is regexp pattern of this plugin:

```text
format /^\[[^ ]* (?<time>[^\]]*)\] \[(?<level>[^\]]*)\](?: \[pid (?<pid>[^\]]*)\])? \[client (?<client>[^\]]*)\] (?<message>.*)$/
```

`level`, `pid`, `client` and `message` are included in the event record. `time` is used for the event time.

## Example

```text
[Wed Oct 11 14:32:52 2000] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] client denied by server configuration
```

This incoming event is parsed as:

```text
time:
971242372 (Wed Oct 11 14:32:52 2000)

record:
{
  "level"  : "error",
  "client" : "127.0.0.1",
  "message": "client denied by server configuration"
}
```
