# single\_value

The `single_value` formatter plugin output the value of a single field instead of the whole record.

This formatter is often used in conjunction with [in\_tail](../input/tail.md)'s `format none`.

## Parameters

### add\_newline \(Boolean, Optional, defaults to true\)

Add `\n` to the result. If there is a trailing "\n" already, set it "false"

### message\_key \(String, Optional, defaults to "message"\)

The value of this field is outputted.

## Example

```text
tag:    app.event
time:   1362020400
record: {"message":"Hello from Fluentd!"}
```

This incoming event is formatted to:

```text
Hello from Fluentd!\n
```
