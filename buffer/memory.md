# memory

The `memory` buffer plugin provides a fast buffer implementation. It uses memory to store buffer chunks. When Fluentd is shut down, buffered logs that can't be written quickly are deleted.

## Example Config

```text
<match pattern>
  buffer_type memory
</match>
```

Please see the [Config File](../configuration/config-file.md) article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

## Parameters

### buffer\_type \(required\)

The value must be `memory`.

### buffer\_chunk\_limit

The size of each buffer chunk. The default is 8m. The suffixes "k" \(KB\), "m" \(MB\), and "g" \(GB\) can be used. Please see the [Buffer Plugin Overview](./) article for the basic buffer structure.

### buffer\_queue\_limit

The length limit of the chunk queue. Please see the [Buffer Plugin Overview](./) article for the basic buffer structure. The default limit is 64 chunks.

### flush\_interval

The interval between data flushes. The suffixes "s" \(seconds\), "m" \(minutes\), and "h" \(hours\) can be used

### flush\_at\_shutdown

If true, queued chunks are flushed at shutdown process. The default is `true`. If false, queued chunks are discarded unlike `buf_file`.

### retry\_wait

The interval between retries. The suffixes "s" \(seconds\), "m" \(minutes\), and "h" \(hours\) can be used.
